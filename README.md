Files for IE343 Statistical ML. This course was theory- and coding-heavy course designed to teach students about statistical analysis and modeling of data. The course included theory and coding homework assignments, which are provided in this repo. Additionally, this course had a final project in the form of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaist-ie343-2023-spring/leaderboard), where I got 7th place out of 60 students who participated. The code for this project and the final report explaining the project notebook are also in this repo.
